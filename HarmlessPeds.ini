[ MaxNearbyPeds | Can be any integer number above 0. 32 is excessive in many cases (as far as I've tested) but works fine; there's no real need to change it. This number is per player; all peds near other players (that your game knows about) will be affected by this, which is ideal for (speedrunning) most missions, however may not work as great in freemode for other players unless you are either near or spectating the other players.]
